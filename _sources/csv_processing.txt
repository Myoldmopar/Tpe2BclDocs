Processing CSV Parameters
*************************

The CSV parameters are typically the performance data for a component at rated conditions.  Performance maps are used to characterize parameters that change dynamically based on conditions.  This isn't always the case, but it is the general idea.

Processing Steps
================

Processing the CSV parameters is a pretty simple process:

* Loop over each row in the csv file
* Read parameter values:

  * Name
  * Value
  * Data Source
  * Other metadata
   
This data goes into a list of parameters (internally a ParameterList class instance).
