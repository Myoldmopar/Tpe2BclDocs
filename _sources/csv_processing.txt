Processing CSV Parameters
*************************

The CSV parameters are typically the performance data for a component at rated conditions.  Performance maps are used to characterize parameters that change dynamically based on conditions.  This isn't always the case, but it is the general idea.

CSV parameters are processed simply.  Loop over each row in the csv file, read the parameter name, value, source, and other metadata into a list of parameters (internally a ParameterList class instance).
