Writing "Base" IDF/OS Data for Rooftop Units
********************************************

The base idf writer for rooftop units has one main goal:

  Create the Rooftop Unit instance, and set as many parameters as possible without generating performance curves.

This translator does this by following the following steps:

* Check which type of heating this unit has, including whether it is a heat pump
* Get the number of heating or cooling speeds

  This is the number of compressor speeds, right?
    </font>

* Roughly speaking, for each speed, the translator reads the cooling/heating rated air flow rate at that speed and tracks the maximum flow rate.
* The translator then creates the RTU object instance, assigning parameters as possible.
* The translator then finally creates the Fan object instance, assigning parameters and hooking it to the RTU.
